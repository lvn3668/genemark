# genemark
Implementation of nth order Markov Chains using Ecoli as training and test set for gene prediction.
Builds nmers of specified length (order) and trains a bayesian probabilistic model. 

Sensitivity and specificity calculated based on how the model detects known genes in test set (same as training)
